Problem Statement : 

ASSIGNMENT SEARCH ENGINE DATABASE

What we aim to do? : 

Getting stuck on an assignment can be a very frustrating experience, even more when you have nowhere to take assist from. 

We as a team, aim to solve this peculiar everyday problem, so that students can learn better and have good night sleeps without any stress. 

How are we gonna do it? 

It would be a compilation of all the resources for (1st, 2nd & 3rd semester) students all compiled in the backend of our website's database. 
With more refinements and additions, getting the answer you need would be just a few fingertips away.
